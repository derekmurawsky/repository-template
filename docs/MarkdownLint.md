# MarkdownLint

[David Anson](https://dlaa.me/)'s [MarkdownLint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) is a fantastic tool to ensure good, standard formatting of [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files. This repository also uses the [vscode extension](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint) for MarkdownLint. For more information, see the [VSCode DevContainers](#devcontainer-support) section.

> The Markdown markup language is designed to be easy to read, write, and understand. It succeeds - and its flexibility is both a benefit and a drawback. Many styles are possible, so formatting can be inconsistent. Some constructs don't work well in all parsers and should be avoided. The CommonMark specification standardizes parsers - but not authors.
>
>markdownlint is a static analysis tool for Node.js with a library of rules to enforce standards and consistency for Markdown files. It was inspired by - and heavily influenced by - Mark Harrison's markdownlint for Ruby. The initial rules, rule documentation, and test cases came directly from that project.
