## Intentionally Left Out

- Signed commits - In this reference repo, I did not feel the need to require signed commits mostly due to the [learning](https://scatteredcode.net/signing-git-commits-using-yubikey-on-windows/) [curve](https://github.com/YubicoLabs/sign-git-commits-yubikey). For any downstream use of this project, I would highly recommend using signed commits.
