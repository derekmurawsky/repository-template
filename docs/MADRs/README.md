# Markdown Architectural Decision Records

Keeping track of the architectural decisions made for a project within the project's documentation is a good way to document and track the *why* of decisions that led to the code being what it is. This repository uses the [Markdown Architectural Decision Record format](https://adr.github.io/madr/) and treats them like [other documentation](decisions/README.md).

> An [Architectural Decision (AD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_decision) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. This might, for instance, be a technology choice (e.g., Java vs. JavaScript), a choice of the IDE (e.g., IntelliJ vs. Eclipse IDE), a choice between a library (e.g., [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) vs [java.util.logging](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html)), or a decision on features (e.g., infinite undo vs. limited undo). Do not take the term “architecture” too seriously or interpret it too strongly. As the examples illustrate, any decisions that might have an impact on the architecture somehow are architectural decisions.
