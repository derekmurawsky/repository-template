# SemVer support

To ease versioning, and adopt a standard that is supported in many tools, this repository uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/).

>Given a version number **MAJOR**.**MINOR**.**PATCH**, increment the:
>
>**MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes,
>
>**MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
>
>**PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
>
>Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
