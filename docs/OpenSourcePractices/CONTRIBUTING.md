# Contributing to this Project

Since this project is currently small in scope, we do not have a robust contribution guide.

- If you would like to discuss a potential feature or change, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/derekmurawsky/repository-template/issues/new) and we can talk it over.
- If you would rather submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/derekmurawsky/repository-template/pulls), feel free! We can talk it through via PR as well.
